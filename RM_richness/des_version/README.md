DES version of Redmapper Richnesses
===================================
Redmapper clusters are defined by their redshift and richnesses.
Eli has provided some fits files with a list of clusters, their
most likely richnesses (at some redshift) as well as a list
of measured richnesses assuming different redshifts.

My goal is to measure the width of the distribution, assuming a
gaussian, around the most likely redshifts.
